# Paste Image URL as embed

Insert external image URLs as embed using regularÂ `Ctrl/Cmd + V`.
This achieves the same as typing `![]()` in Markdown.

Pasting a URL only checks for the file extension.

Use the command palette/hotkey (needs to be set manually) on a text selection to embed image URLs even without a file extension.

- [obsidian-url-into-selection](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection) This project was very helpful for building this plugin
- [This](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/verify-image-url) blog article was helpful to not only rely on Regex for recognizing an image url
